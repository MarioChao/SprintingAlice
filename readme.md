# Sprinting Alice

## Intro
### Alice was the leader of the delver team in Wonderland.
<br/>
On one expedition to explore an abyss, the walls suddenly collapsed.
The delvers dodged the fractures of the walls and made it until the incident stopped.
Suddenly, Alice was captured and taken away by a mysterious entity.
The delver team ran toward the direction of the entity, but it got away pretty fast.

As the team was thinking about saving Alice, Anne, the co-leader of the team, decided to first get the team to evacuate the abyss.

Allie, who was quite experienced with navigating platforms, was going to be the one leading the team.
