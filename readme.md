# Sprinting Alice

## Intro
Alice was the leader of the delver team in Wonderland.
<br/>
On one expedition to explore an abyss, the walls suddenly collapsed.
The delvers dodged the fractures of the walls and made it until the incident stopped.
Suddenly, Alice was captured and taken away by a mysterious entity.
The delver team ran toward the direction of the entity, but it got away pretty fast.

As the team was thinking about saving Alice, Anne, the co-leader of the team, decided to first get the team to evacuate the abyss.
<br/>
Allie, who was quite experienced with navigating platforms, was going to be the one leading the team.

## Rules
Go around each level and find a goal flag to complete it.
<br/>
When you fall off the map, you'll start over from a save-point. When you run out of lives, you still start over from a save-point, but you also lose your coins.
<br/>
The blue slimes are cute and are harmless. Try not to kill them.

## Instructions
Use arrow keys to move the player. Use the space key to jump. The jump height depends on the x-velocity because Mario doesn't understand how momentum works. (just kidding, it is a unique and interesting feature)

## Hints
Each level has some deep and definitely intentional symbolism about pride. Try to figure it out.
<br/>
In the second level, each cloud-shaped powerup will increase your x velocity.
<br/>
In the third level, each moon-shaped powerup will increase your jump height.
<br/>
It is easy to see where you're going in the first level, but it is... much harder... in the second and third levels.
